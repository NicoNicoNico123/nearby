# Nearby App Development Plan - UI-First MVP

## Project Overview
This plan outlines a UI-first MVP approach for the Nearby social dining app, a HeyMandi-inspired Flutter application. The focus is on building core UI screens and user experience first, with backend complexity deferred to post-MVP.

## UI Reference Screens Structure
The app will be built around these core UI screens (based on `UI reference/` directory):
- **welcome/** - Onboarding and app introduction
- **discover_page/** - Location-based discovery feed
- **feed/** - Main content feed interface
- **group_info_view/** - Group details and management
- **messaging/** - Real-time chat interface
- **settings/** - User settings and preferences
- **user_profile/** - Profile management and editing

     │   ├── group_info_view/
     │   ├── messaging/
     │   ├── settings/
     │   └── user_profile/
     ├── widgets/ (shared UI components)
     ├── models/ (data models)

## Step 8: Mock Data Service Layer
1. **Create Mock Data Service**
   - Build service layer for all screens
   - Generate realistic user profiles with photos, bios, interests
   - Create sample groups with various intents and sizes
   - Generate mock chat messages with realistic content
   - Implement location-based mock user generation
   - Add data persistence across app sessions

## Step 9: Integration & Polish
1. **Integrate Mock Data with UI**
   - Connect all screens to mock data service

   - Ensure data consistency across screens

2. **UI Polish & Refinement**
   - Fix UI inconsistencies and polish animations
   - Ensure dark theme consistency across all screens
   - Test responsive design on different screen sizes
   - Final testing and bug fixes

- **Small Widgets**: Prefer composable widgets over large monolithic ones
- **Proper Logging**: Use `dart:developer` for logging, not `print` statements

## MVP Success Criteria
- All 7 UI reference screens implemented and functional
- Complete user flow from onboarding to group chat
- Mock data integration demonstrating full app experience
- Clean, HeyMandi-inspired interface with minimal friction
- Responsive design across all device sizes
- Basic safety UI elements (report/block buttons)

## Testing Strategy (Simplified for MVP)
- [ ] Basic UI validation for all screens
- [ ] User flow testing with mock data
- [ ] Responsive design testing on multiple screen sizes
- [ ] Theme consistency validation
- [ ] Navigation flow testing

## Implementation Summary

**MVP (UI-First)**: 9 implementation steps
1. **Project Foundation & Architecture** - Setup, theme, navigation
2. **Core UI Components Development** - Reusable widgets and utilities
3. **Welcome & Onboarding Screens** - First user experience
4. **User Profile Management** - Profile creation and settings
5. **Discovery & Feed Implementation** - Location-based discovery

7. **Messaging System** - Basic chat functionality
8. **Mock Data Service Layer** - Realistic data for demonstration
9. **Integration & Polish** - Complete user experience testing

**Post-MVP Features**: Additional phases as needed based on user feedback and business priorities

## Key MVP Decisions
- **No points system** in MVP - focus on core social functionality
- **No real-time features** like typing indicators - basic chat only
- **Mock data service** - no backend integration for MVP
- **Basic safety UI** - report/block buttons that log actions
- **Location permission** handled in onboarding flow
