Please create a subfolder in the specs folder for this specific feature.
Within the folder, create two files: requirements.md and implementation-plan.md.

The requirements file should contain our initial requirements, with any other functional and non-functional requirements as well as acceptance criteria.

For the implementation plan, I needed to create a detailed implementation plan that is split into separate phases. Each phase should contain an actionable list of tasks with checkboxes so that we can track our progress. At this stage, do not include any unit or end-to-end testing.
